## Python uses two types of operators: arithmetic and assignment

## + Addition operator that adds two values together 1 + 1
## - Subtraction operator that removes the value of the right side from the left side 1 - 2
## / Division operator that divides the left side as many times as the right side specifies	10 / 2
## * Multiplication operator 2 * 2 

## Operator Example
## = x = 2
## x now contains 2.
## += x += 2
## x incremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
## -= x -= 2
## x decremented by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 0.
## /=	x /= 2
## x divided by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 1.
## *=	x *= 2
## x multiplied by 2. If it contained 2 before, it now has a value of 4.
